Adaptive, or self-\/aware, computing has been proposed as one method to help application programmers confront the growing complexity of multicore software development.

However, existing approaches to adaptive systems are largely ad hoc and often do not manage to incorporate the true performance goals of the applications they are designed to support.

This project proposed an enabling technology for adaptive computing systems\+: Application Heartbeats. The Application Heartbeats framework provides a simple, standard programming interface that applications can use to indicate their performance and system software (and hardware) can use to query an application\textquotesingle{}s performance.
