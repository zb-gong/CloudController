## [v0.2.0] - 2017-12-11

### Added

* Silence error messages when errors are anticipated and handled

### Deprecated

* The libmsr implementation is no longer a primary RAPLCap backend and may be removed in the future

### Fixed

* Enable zones even if clamping can't be set (not available for all zones/platforms)
* Fixed "raplcap_is_zone_supported" in MSR implementation
* Only operate on short term constraints in powercap implementation if zone supports it


## [v0.1.2] - 2017-11-12

### Added

* Added man page for rapl-configure binaries

### Changed

* Upstream libmsr removed functionality for PP0/PP1 (core and uncore) zones, so we check for functions during build
