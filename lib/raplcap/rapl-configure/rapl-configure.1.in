.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) configures \fIpower limits\fP on
hardware that are respected on average over a \fItime window\fP.
An Intel\*R Sandy Bridge (2nd generation Intel\*R Core) or newer processor is
required.
Users are expected to have some familiarity with RAPL before using this tool.
Refer to the "Intel\*R 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manual,
Volume 3: System Programming Guide" for more technical information.
This description is only a short summary.
.LP
RAPL control is structured into \fIzones\fP, also known as \fIdomains\fP.
Currently supported zones are:
.IP \[bu] 2
\fIPackage\fP: a processor package die, including cores and other shared
resources like the uncore components below and a DRAM controller.
.IP \[bu]
\fICore\fP: the processor core, like compute components and private caches
(often L1 and L2).
Core is also known as \fIPP0\fP, or Power Plane 0.
.IP \[bu]
\fIUncore\fP: non-core processor components like shared/last-level caches
(often L3) and any integrated graphics hardware.
Uncore is also known as \fIPP1\fP, or Power Plane 1, and is typically only
available on client processors like those for desktops and laptops.
.IP \[bu]
\fIDRAM\fP: directly-attached main memory.
DRAM power capping is typically only available on server systems, but has been
spotted on some client hardware.
.IP \[bu]
\fIPSys\fP: the entire platform/system.
PSys is also known as \fIPlatform\fP and is only available on Intel\*R Skylake
(6th generation Intel\*R Core) and newer processors, and requires additional
BIOS support.
.LP
Package and PSys zones support two power limits, or \fIconstraints\fP - \fIlong
term\fP and \fIshort term\fP.
Package zones may also support a \fIpeak power\fP constraint on some
processors.
Other zones support a single constraint (long term).
.LP
Actual power limit and time window values are system-dependent.
Refer to your hardware's technical documentation, particularly for the Thermal
Design Power (TDP).
.LP
Package, Core, Uncore, and DRAM zones may exist for each die in each processor
package, although many systems only have a single package with a single die.
.LP
By default, rapl\-configure\-@RAPL_LIB@ uses the PACKAGE zone on package 0,
die 0.
Current values are printed if no flags, or only package, die, and/or zone flags
are specified.
Otherwise, specified values are set while other values remain unmodified.

.SH "REMARKS"
.LP
Administrative (root) privileges are usually needed to access RAPL settings.
.LP
Not all zones are supported by all systems.
Some systems may not allow configuring or enabling/disabling supported zones,
even if they expose the configurations.
.LP
Power and time window values are not always stored exactly as specified.
This is a result of how values are encoded in the Model-Specific Registers.
When using the powercap backend, some accuracy may also be lost as the
interface forces rounding values to microJoule and microsecond precision.
.LP
Historically, the term \fIsocket\fP was used interchangeably with \fIpackage\fP.
While there used to only ever be a single processor package per socket, this
symmetry no longer holds - sockets may contain multiple packages.
